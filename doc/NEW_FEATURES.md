# Bundler Feature Requests

## Substantial Features

To request substantial changes to Bundler or Bundler documentation, please refer to the [RFC repository](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs). See the [README](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/blob/master/README.md) for detailed instructions on the RFC process.

## Contributing New Features

To add a new feature to Bundler:

1. **Discuss your idea** - [Open an issue](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues/new) to discuss your proposed feature
2. **Base on master branch** - We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org), so new features go in the master branch only, not old releases
3. **Write tests** - Include at least one test covering your changes in your feature branch
4. **Submit a pull request** - See [PULL_REQUESTS.md](PULL_REQUESTS.md) for detailed guidelines

Don't be discouraged if you don't hear back immediately—we all have day jobs, but we typically respond to most tickets within a day or two.
