# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ruby/rubygems! Community involvement is essential to both RubyGems and Bundler. We welcome contributions from everyone, and we want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the terms of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Before submitting a contribution:

1. **Set up your development environment** - See [GETTING_STARTED.md](doc/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions
2. **Understand the repository structure** - This is a monorepo containing both RubyGems and Bundler:
   - RubyGems code is in the root `lib/` and `exe/` directories
   - Bundler code is in the `bundler/` subdirectory

## Contribution Guidelines

All contributions to this repository should follow these guidelines:

1. **Write tests** - New features must be coupled with tests. Bug fixes should include a test that reproduces the issue.

2. **Code style compliance**:
   - No trailing whitespace
   - Use two-space indentation
   - Run `bin/rake rubocop` to check style compliance

3. **File management** (RubyGems only):
   - If you add or remove files in the RubyGems portion of the repo, update `Manifest.txt` by running `bin/rake update_manifest`

4. **Preserve version history**:
   - Don't modify version numbers or changelog files directly; maintainers handle these

5. **Ask questions** - Have questions? Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues)

For more information on contributing to the RubyGems ecosystem, see [guides.rubygems.org/contributing](https://guides.rubygems.org/contributing/).

## First-Time Contributors

We track [good first issues](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abundler+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to help new contributors get started. Here are some great ways to begin:

- **Test prerelease versions**: Run `gem install bundler --pre` and report any issues
- **Report bugs or suggest features**: [Open an issue](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues/new?labels=Bundler&template=bundler-related-issue.md) (see [new features documentation](bundler/development/NEW_FEATURES.md))
- **Improve documentation**: Contribute to the [Bundler website](https://bundler.io) or [man pages](https://bundler.io/man/bundle.1.html)
- **Triage issues**: [Check issue completeness](doc/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md) and help close incomplete reports
- **Write tests**: Add failing tests for [reported bugs](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues) or backfill missing test coverage
- **Review pull requests**: Provide feedback on [pull requests](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/pulls)
- **Improve code**: No patch is too small—fix typos, improve code clarity, or clean up whitespace
- **Contribute features**: See [adding new features](bundler/development/NEW_FEATURES.md)

## Pull Request Guidelines

See [bundler/development/PULL_REQUESTS.md](bundler/development/PULL_REQUESTS.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Community and Support

Community involvement is vital to both projects:

- **Answer questions**: Help others on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bundler) (questions about RubyGems, Bundler, and Ruby in general are welcome)
- **Share knowledge**: Write blog posts, create examples, make videos, or share your experiences
- **Improve documentation**: Suggest improvements to [bundler.io](https://bundler.io) via issues or pull requests on the [bundler-site](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler-site) repository

## Supporting the Projects

Both RubyGems and Bundler are managed by [Ruby Central](https://rubycentral.org), a non-profit organization supporting the Ruby community through projects like these, as well as [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org) and [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).

You can support Ruby Central by:
